### July 22 lightning talk for [#emberyvr](http://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Ember-js/events/194078372/)

My first attempt at uber-nerding a presentation by staying in tmux the entire time. Includes working Gruntfile.js and Gulpfile.js

```
npm install
npm install grunt -g
grunt build
gulp build
```

To run the presentation in vim, you must first install [vimdeck](https://github.com/tybenz/vimdeck).
